Junayed Mahmud is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu">University of Central Florida</a>. He works at the <a href="https://sagelab.io">SAGE Research Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.kpmoran.com">Dr. Kevin Moran</a>. Junayed graduated with his M.S. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University, USA</a> in 2023 and B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu">Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh</a> in 2016. He worked at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/srbd">Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh Limited</a> before starting his Ph.D. His primary research interests include Automated Bug Report Management, specifically assessing bug report quality, bug localization, and UI-centric program repair. This research utilizes empirical methods, leverages multimodal information resources (e.g., bug reports, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and source code), and adapts multiple techniques based on information retrieval, program analysis, and machine/deep learning. Additionally, he works on improving automated software documentation utilizing the information available from GUIs and source code.
